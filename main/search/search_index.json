These keys are documented in the individual source files in this section, and allow one to override Splunk metadata either in whole or part. The use of this file is best shown by example.  Here is the Netscreen \u201cSourcetype and Index Configuration\u201d table from the Juniper source documentation:</p> key sourcetype index notes juniper_netscreen netscreen:firewall netfw none <p>Here is a line from a typical <code>splunk_metadata.csv</code> override file:</p> <pre><code>juniper_netscreen,index,ns_index\n</code></pre> <p>The columns in this file are <code>key</code>, <code>metadata</code>, and <code>value</code>.  To make a change via the override file, consult the <code>example</code> file (or the source documentation) for the proper key when overriding an existing source and modify and/or add rows in the table, specifying one or more of the following <code>metadata/value</code> pairs for a given <code>key</code>:</p> <ul> <li><code>key</code> which refers to the vendor and product name of the data source, using the <code>vendor_product</code> convention.  For overrides, these keys    will be listed in the <code>example</code> file.  For new (custom) sources, be sure to choose a key that accurately reflects the vendor and product    being configured, and that matches what is specified in the log path.</li> <li><code>index</code> to specify an alternate <code>value</code> for index</li> <li><code>source</code> to specify an alternate <code>value</code> for source</li> <li><code>host</code> to specify an alternate <code>value</code> for host</li> <li><code>sourcetype</code> to specify an alternate <code>value</code> for sourcetype (be very careful when changing this; only do so if an upstream     TA is not being used, or a custom TA (built by you) is being used.)</li> <li><code>sc4s_template</code> to specify an alternate <code>value</code> for the syslog-ng template that will be used to format the event that will be    indexed by Splunk.  Changing this carries the same warning as the sourcetype above; this will affect the upstream TA.  The template    choices are documented elsewhere in this Configuration section.</li> </ul> <p>In our example above, the <code>juniper_netscreen</code> key references a new index used for that data source called <code>ns_index</code>.</p> <p>In general, for most deployments the index should be the only change needed; other default metadata should almost never be overridden (particularly for the \u201cOut of the Box\u201d data sources).  Even then, care should be taken when considering any alternates, as the defaults for SC4S were chosen with best practices in mind.</p> <ul> <li> <p>NOTE:  The <code>splunk_metadata.csv</code> file is a true override file and the entire <code>example</code> file should not be copied over to the override.  In most cases, the override file is just one or two lines, unless an entire index category (e.g. <code>netfw</code>) needs to be overridden. This is similar in concept to the \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d conf file precedence in Splunk Enterprise.</p> </li> <li> <p>NOTE The <code>splunk_metadata.csv</code> file should always be appended with an appropriate new key and default for the index when building a custom SC4S log path, as the new key will not exist in the internal lookup (nor the <code>example</code> file).  Care should be taken during log path design to choose appropriate index, sourcetype and template defaults so that admins are not compelled to override them.  If the custom log path is later added to the list of SC4S-supported sources, this addendum can be removed.</p> </li> <li> <p>NOTE:  As noted above, the <code>splunk_metadata.csv.example</code> file is provided for reference only and is not used directly by SC4S.  However, it is an exact copy of the internal file, and can therefore change from release to release.  Be sure to check the example file first to make sure the keys for any overrides map correctly to the ones in the example file.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"configuration/#override-index-or-metadata-based-on-host-ip-or-subnet-compliance-overrides","title":"Override index or metadata based on host, ip, or subnet (compliance overrides)","text":"<p>In other cases it is appropriate to provide the same overrides but based on PCI scope, geography, or other criterion rather than globally.

In addition, (indexed) fields can also be added to further classify the data.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>conf</code> and <code>csv</code> files referenced below will be populated into the <code>/opt/sc4s/local/context</code> directory when SC4S is run for the first time after being set up according to the \u201cgetting started\u201d runtime documents, in a similar fashion to <code>splunk_metadata.csv</code>.

In this case, any incoming message with a hostname starting with <code>something-</code> or arriving from a netmask of <code>192.168.100.1/24</code> will match the <code>f_test_test</code> filter, and the corresponding entries in the <code>csv</code> file will be checked for overrides. In this case, the new index is <code>pciindex</code>, and an indexed field named <code>compliance</code> will be sent to Splunk, with it\u2019s value set to <code>pci</code>.

This capability utilizes the disk buffering feature of Syslog-ng. SC4S receives a response from the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) when a message is received successfully. If a confirmation message from the HEC endpoint is not received (or a \u201cserver busy\u201d reply, such as a \u201c503\u201d is sent), the load balancer will try the next HEC endpoint in the pool. If all pool members are exhausted (such as would occur if there were a full network outage to the HEC endpoints), events will queue to the local disk buffer on the SC4S Linux host. SC4S will continue attempting to send the failed events while it buffers all new incoming events to disk. If the disk space allocated to disk buffering fills up then SC4S will stop accepting new events and subsequent events will be lost. Once SC4S gets confirmation that events are again being received by one or more indexers, events will then stream from the buffer using FIFO queueing. The number of events in the disk buffer will reduce as long as the incoming event volume is less than the maximum SC4S (with the disk buffer in the path) can handle. When all events have been emptied from the disk buffer, SC4S will resume streaming events directly to Splunk.</p> <p>For more detail on the Syslog-ng behavior the documentation can be found here: https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.22/administration-guide/55#TOPIC-1209280</p> <p>SC4S has disk buffering enabled by default and it is strongly recommended that you keep it on, however this feature does have a performance cost. Without disk buffering enabled SC4S can handle up to 345K EPS (800 bytes/event avg) With \u201cNormal\u201d disk buffering enabled SC4S can handle up to 60K EPS (800 bytes/event avg) \u2013 This is still a lot of data!</p> <p>To guard against data loss it is important to configure the appropriate type and amount of storage for SC4S disk buffering. To estimate the storage allocation, follow these steps:</p> <ul> <li>Start with your estimated maximum events per second that each SC4S server will experience. Based on the maximum throughput of SC4S with disk buffering enabled, the conservative estimate for maximum events per second would be 60K (however, you should use the maximum rate in your environment for this calculation, not the max rate SC4S can handle). </li> <li>Next is your average estimated event size based on your data sources. It is common industry practice to estimate log events as 800 bytes on average. </li> <li>Then, factor in the maximum length of connectivity downtime you want disk buffering to be able to handle. This measure is very much dependent on your risk tolerance.</li> <li>Lastly, syslog-ng imposes significant overhead to maintain its internal data structures (primarily macros) so that the data can be properly \u201cplayed back\u201d upon network restoration.  This overhead currently runs at about 1.7x above the total storage size for the raw messages themselves, and can be higher for \u201cfallback\u201d data sources due to the overlap of syslog-ng macros (data fields) containing some or all of the original message.</li> </ul> <p>For example, to protect against a full day of lost connectivity from SC4S to all your indexers at maximum throughput the calculation would look like the following:</p> <p>60,000 EPS * 86400 seconds * 800 bytes * 1.7 = 6.4 TB of storage</p> <p>To configure storage allocation for the SC4S disk buffering, do the following:</p> <ul> <li>Edit the file /opt/sc4s/default/env_file</li> <li>Add the SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DISKBUFF_DISKBUFSIZE variable to the file and set the value to the number of bytes based on your estimation (e.g. 7050240000000 in the example above)</li> <li>Splunk does not recommend reducing the disk allocation below 500 GB</li> <li>Restart SC4S</li> </ul> <p>Given that in a connectivity outage to the Indexers events will be saved and read from disk until the buffer is emptied, it is ideal to use the fastest type of storage available. For this reason, NVMe storage is recommended for SC4S disk buffering.</p> <p>It is best to design your deployment so that the disk buffer will drain after connectivity is restored to the Splunk Indexers (while incoming data continues at the same general rate).  Since \u201cyour mileage may vary\u201d with different combinations of data load, instance type, and disk subsystem performance, it is good practice to provision a box that performs twice as well as is required for your max EPS.

Why should I switch to an HTTP Event Collector (HEC) based architecture?</p> <p>A:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Using HEC to stream events directly to the indexers provides superior load balancing, and has shown to produce more even data distribution across the indexers. This even distribution results in significantly enhanced search performance. This benefit is especially valuable in large Splunk deployments.</p> </li> <li> <p>The HEC architecture designed in SC4S is also easier to administer with newer versions of syslog-ng. There are fewer opportunities for configuration errors, resulting in higher overall performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>HEC, and in particular the \u201c/event\u201d endpoint, offers the opportunity for a far richer data stream to Splunk, with lower resource utilization at ingest time. This rich data stream can be taken advantage of in next-generation add-ons. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Q: Is the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) as reliable as the Splunk universal forwarder?</p> <p>A: HEC utilizes standard HTTP mechanisms to confirm that the endpoint is responsive before sending data. The HEC architecture allows you to use an industry standard load balancer between SC4S and the indexer or the included load balancing capability built into SC4S itself.</p> <p>Q: What if my team doesn\u2019t know how to manage containers?</p> <p>A: Using a runtime like Podman to deploy and manage SC4S containers is exceptionally easy even for those with no prior \u201ccontainer experience\u201d. Our application of container technology behaves much like a packaging system. The interaction uses \u201csystemctl\u201d commands a Linux admin would use for other common administration activities. The best approach is to try it out in a lab to see what the experience is like for yourself!</p> <p>Q: Can my team use SC4S with Windows?</p> <p>A: You can now run Docker on Windows! Microsoft has introduced public preview technology for Linux containers on Windows. Alternatively, a minimal Centos/Ubuntu Linux VM running on Windows hyper-v is a reliable production-grade choice. </p> <p>Q: My company has the traditional universal forwarder and files-based syslog architecture deployed and running, should I rip and replace a working installation with SC4S?</p> <p>A: Generally speaking, if a deployment is working and you are happy with it, it\u2019s best to leave it as is until there is need for major deployment changes, such as scaling your configuration. The search performance improvements from better data distribution is one benefit, so if Splunk users have complained about search performance or you are curious about the possible performance gains, we recommend doing an analysis of the data distribution across the indexers.</p> <p>Q: What is the best way to migrate to SC4S from an existing syslog architecture?</p> <p>A: When exploring migration to SC4S we strongly recommend that you experiment in a lab prior to deployment to production. There are a couple of approaches to consider: </p> <ul> <li>The following approach may result in the fewest duplicate events in Splunk versus other options. In some large or complex environments this may not be feasible however:</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Configure the new SC4S infrastructure for all your sources.</li> <li>Confirm all the sourcetypes are being indexed as expected.</li> <li>Stop the existing syslog servers.</li> </ol> <ul> <li>You can also start with the sources currently sending events on port 514 (the default):</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Stand up the new SC4S infrastructure in its default configuration.</li> <li>Confirm that all the sourcetypes are being indexed as expected.</li> <li>Retire the old syslog servers listening on port 514.</li> <li>Once the 514 sources are complete, migrate any other sources. To do this, configure SC4S filters to explicitly identify them either through a unique port, hostID, or CIDR block.</li> <li>Once you confirm that each sourcetype is successfully indexed, disable the old syslog configurations for that source. </li> </ol> <p>Q: How can SC4S be deployed to provide high availability?</p> <p>A: The syslog protocol was not designed with HA as a goal, so configuration can be challenging. See Performant AND Reliable Syslog UDP is best for an excellent overview of this topic.</p> <p>The syslog protocol limits the extent to which you can make any syslog collection architecture HA; at best it can be made \u201cmostly available\u201d. To do this, keep it simple and use OS clustering (shared IP) or even just VMs with vMotion. This simple architecture will encounter far less data loss over time than more complicated schemes. Another possible option is containerization HA schemes for SC4S (centered around MicroK8s) that will take some of the administrative burden of clustering away, but still functions as OS clustering under the hood.</p> <p>Q: I\u2019m worried about data loss if SC4S goes down. Could I feed syslog to redundant SC4S servers to provide HA, without creating duplicate events in Splunk?</p> <p>A: In many system design decisions there is some level of compromise. Any network protocol that doesn\u2019t have an application level ACK will lose data because speed is selected over reliability in the design. This is the case with syslog. Use a clustered IP with an active/passive node for a level of resilience while keeping complexity to a minimum.  It could be possible to implement a far more complex solution utilizing an additional intermediary technology like Kafka, however the costs may outweigh the real world benefits.</p> <p>Q: If the XL reference HW can handle just under 1 terabyte per day, how can SC4S be scaled to handle large deployments of many terabytes per day?</p> <p>A: SC4S is a distributed architecture. SC4S instances should be deployed in the same VLAN as the source devices. This means that each SC4S instance will only see a subset of the total syslog traffic in a large deployment. Even in a deployment of 100 terabytes or greater, the individual SC4S instances will see loads in gigabytes per day rather than terabytes per day.</p> <p>Q: SC4S is being blocked by <code>fapolicyd</code>, how do I fix that?</p> <p>A: Create a rule that allows running SC4S in <code>fapolicyd</code> configuration:</p> <ul> <li>Create the file <code>/etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/15-sc4s.rules</code>.</li> <li>Edit the file to add: <code>allow perm=open exe=/ : dir=/usr/lib64/ all trust=1</code>.</li> <li>Run <code>fagenrules --load</code> to load the new rule.</li> <li>Run <code>systemctl restart fapolicyd</code> to restart the process.</li> <li>Start <code>sc4s systemctl start sc4s</code> and verify that there are no errors <code>systemctl status sc4s</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Q: I am facing a unique issue that my postfilter configuration is not working although I don\u2019t have any postfilter for the mentioned source?</p> <p>A: There may be a OOB postfilter for the source which will be applied, validate this by checking the value of <code>sc4s_tags</code> in Splunk. To resolve this, see <code>[sc4s-finalfilter]</code>. Do not use this resolution in any other situation as it can add the cost of the data processing.</p> <p>Q: Where should the configuration for the vendors be placed? There are folders of app-parsers and  directories. Which one to use? Does this also mean that csv files for metadata are no longer required?</p> <p>A: The configuration for vendors should be placed in <code>/opt/sc4s/local/config/*/.conf</code>. Most of the folders are placeholders, the configuration will work in any of these folders with a <code>.conf</code> extension. CSV should be placed in <code>local/context/*.csv</code>. Using <code>splunk_metadata.csv</code> is good for metadata override, but use <code>.conf</code> file for everything else in place of other csv files.</p> <p>Q: Can we have a file in which we can create all default indexes in one effort?</p> <p>A: Refer to indexes.conf, which contains all indexes being created in one effort. This file also has <code>lastChanceIndex</code> configured, to use if it fits your requirements. For more information on this file, please refer Splunk docs.</p>"},{"location":"lb/","title":"About using load balancers","text":"<p>Load balancers are not a best practice for SC4S.
