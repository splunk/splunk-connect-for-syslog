# README

Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source packaged solution for 
getting data into Splunk using syslog-ng (OSE) and the Splunk 
HTTP event Collector. 

## Purpose

Splunk Connect for Syslog (SC4S) is a community project focused on reducing the pain of getting syslog data sources into Splunk. The primary pain points SC4S addresses include the following…

* Shortage of deep syslog expertise in the community
* Inconsistency between syslog server deployments creates a support challenge
* Data sources tagged with catch-all sourcetype “syslog” which limits Splunk analytics
* Uneven data distribution between Splunk indexers impacts search performance
* Splunk Connect for Syslog should be used by any Splunk customer needing to onboard data sources via syslog to Splunk.
