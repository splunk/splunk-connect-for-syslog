# README

Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source packaged solution for 
getting data into Splunk using syslog-ng (OSE) and the Splunk 
HTTP event Collector. 

## Purpose

Splunk Connect for Syslog (SC4S) is a community project focused on reducing the pain of getting syslog data sources into Splunk. The primary pain points SC4S addresses include the following…

* Shortage of deep syslog expertise in the community
* Inconsistency between syslog server deployments creates a support challenge
* Data sources tagged with catch-all sourcetype “syslog” which limits Splunk analytics
* Uneven data distribution between Splunk indexers impacts search performance
* Splunk Connect for Syslog should be used by any Splunk customer needing to onboard data sources via syslog to Splunk.

## Usage

For full usage instructions, please visit the Splunk Connect for Syslog [documentation pages over at readthedocs](https://splunk-connect-for-syslog.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

## Support

Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. This unique product will be enhanced, maintained and supported by the community, led by Splunkers with deep subject matter expertise. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.
