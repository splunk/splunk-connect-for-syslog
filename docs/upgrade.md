# Upgrading Splunk Connect for Syslog

Splunk Connect for Syslog is updated regularly using a CI/CD development process.  The notes below outline significant changes that
must be taken into account prior and after an upgrade.  Ensure to follow specific instructions below to ensure a smooth
transition to a new version of SC4S in production.

## Upgrade process

Check the current version of SC4S by running ```sudo <docker or podman> logs SC4S```. For the latest version, use the
`latest` tag for the SC4S image in the sc4s.service unit file:

```
[Service]
Environment="SC4S_IMAGE=ghcr.io/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/container3:latest"
```

Restart the service
```sudo systemctl restart sc4s```

Using the "3" version is recommended, but a specific version can be set in the unit file if desired:

```
[Service]
Environment="SC4S_IMAGE=ghcr.io/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/container3:3.0.0"
```

See the [release information](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/releases) for more detail.

## Upgrade Notes
Version 3 does not introduce any breaking change. To upgrade to version 3 review service file and change container reference from `container2` to `container3`.
For a step by step guide [see here](./v3_upgrade.md).
Need up migrating legacy "log paths" or v1 app-parsers for v2. Open an issue with the original config attached and a compressed pcap of sample data for testing and we will evaluate inclusion of the source in an upcoming release.
