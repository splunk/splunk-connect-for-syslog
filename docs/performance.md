# Performance and Sizing
Performance testing against our lab configuration produces the following results and limitations. 

## Tested Configuration

* SC4S instance with 2,4,8,12 vCPU using M5zn instances
* Loggen instance m5zn.large
* Single instance Splunk using m5zn.3xlarge

## Result  

```
/opt/syslog-ng/bin/loggen -i --rate=100000 --interval=180 -P -F --sdata="[test name=\"stress17\"]" -s 800 --active-connections=10 hostname 514

# m5zn.large	2	8 GiB
average rate = 24077.33 msg/sec, count=4375116, time=181.711, (average) msg size=800, bandwidth=18810.42 kB/sec
# m5zn.xlarge	4	16 GiB
average rate = 38797.44 msg/sec, count=7028962, time=181.171, (average) msg size=800, bandwidth=30310.50 kB/sec

## Guidance on sizing hardware

* While vCPU was used (hyper threading) syslog processing is a CPU intensive task obersubscription (sharing) resources is not advised
* The size of the instance must be larger than the absolute peek to prevent data loss as most source can not buffer during times of congestion
* CPU Speed is critical slower or faster CPUs will impact througput
* Not all sources are equal in cost. While in this test we used well formed "legacy BSD" syslog messages many sources are not well formed and require additional time to process.
