# Setup

* Create the systemd unit file `/lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service` based on the following template:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=SC4S Container
After=network.service
Requires=network.service

[Service]
Environment="SC4S_IMAGE=splunk/scs:latest"

#Note Uncomment the following line to use custom index names AND download the splunk_index.csv file template per getting started
Environment="SC4S_UNIT_SPLUNK_INDEX=-v /opt/sc4s/default/splunk_index.csv:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/context-local/splunk_index.csv"

#Note Uncomment the following two lines for host and ip based source type mapping AND download the two file templates per getting started
Environment="SC4S_UNIT_VP_CSV=-v /opt/sc4s/default/vendor_product_by_source.csv:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/context-local/vendor_product_by_source.csv"
Environment="SC4S_UNIT_VP_CONF=-v /opt/sc4s/default/vendor_product_by_source.conf:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/context-local/vendor_product_by_source.conf"

#Uncomment the following line if custom TLS certs are provided
#Environment="SC4S_TLS_DIR=-v /opt/sc4s/tls:/opt/syslog-ng/tls"

TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always

ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman pull $SC4S_IMAGE
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman run \
        --env-file=/opt/sc4s/default/env_file \
        "$SC4S_UNIT_SPLUNK_INDEX" "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CSV" "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CONF" "$SC4S_TLS_DIR" \
        --name SC4S_preflight --rm \
        $SC4S_IMAGE -s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run -p 514:514 -p 514:514/udp \
        --env-file=/opt/sc4s/default/env_file \
        "$SC4S_UNIT_SPLUNK_INDEX"  "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CSV" "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CONF" "$SC4S_TLS_DIR" \
        --name SC4S --rm \
$SC4S_IMAGE
```

* NOTE:  If you use the default `Environment` assignments as-is from the `sc4s.service` unit file template example, do create and/or download all files and directories referenced in the file's Service stanza according to the configuration steps that follow.  The TLS-specific options are described in the "Configure the sc4s environment" section.

## Configure the sc4s environment

Create a file named ``/opt/sc4s/default/env_file`` and add the following environment variables:

```dotenv
SPLUNK_HEC_URL=https://splunk.smg.aws:8088/services/collector/event
SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN=a778f63a-5dff-4e3c-a72c-a03183659e94
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS=6
SPLUNK_CONNECT_METHOD=hec
SPLUNK_DEFAULT_INDEX=main
SPLUNK_METRICS_INDEX=em_metrics
#Uncomment the following line if using untrusted SSL certificates
#SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_TLS_VERIFY=no
```

* Update ``SPLUNK_HEC_URL`` and ``SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN`` to reflect the correct values for your environment

* Set `SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS` to match the number of indexers and/or HWFs with HEC endpoints.  If the endpoint is a VIP,
match this value to the total number of indexers behind the load balancer.

* NOTE:  Splunk Connect for Syslog defaults to secure configurations.  If you are not using trusted SSL certificates, be sure to
uncomment the last line in the example.


## Configure index destinations for Splunk 

Log paths are preconfigured to utilize a convention of index destinations that are suitable for most customers. 

* Create a directory (e.g. ``/opt/sc4s/default/`` ).  Make sure the local directory references in the `sc4s.service` unit file match the directory you create here (the ``-v`` variables).  From this directory, execute the following to download the latest index context file:

```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/master/package/etc/context-local/splunk_index.csv
```
* Edit splunk_index.csv to review the index configuration and revise as required for the sourcertypes utilized in your environment.

## Configure sources by source IP or host name

Legacy sources and non-standard-compliant sources require configuration by source IP or hostname as included in the event. The following steps apply to support such sources. To identify sources that require this step, refer to the "sources" section of this documentation. 

* If not already done, create a directory (e.g. ``/opt/sc4s/default/`` ).  Make sure the local directory references in the `sc4s.service` unit file match the directory you create here (the ``-v`` variables). From this directory, execute the following to download the latest vendor context files:

```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/master/package/etc/context-local/vendor_product_by_source.conf
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/master/package/etc/context-local/vendor_product_by_source.csv
```
* If you have legacy sources and non-standard-compliant sources, edit the file to properly identify these products by host glob or network mask using syslog-ng filter syntax.

## Configure SC4S for systemd and start SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl enable sc4s
sudo systemctl start sc4s
```

# Configure Dedicated Listening Ports

For certain source technologies, categorization by message content is impossible due to the lack of a unique "fingerprint" in
the data.  In other cases, a unique listening port is required for certain devices due to network requirements in the enterprise.  
For collection of such sources we provide a means of dedicating a unique listening port to a specific source.

Refer to the "Sources" documentation to identify the specific variable used to enable a specific port for the technology in use.

In the following example ``-p 5000-5020:5000-5020`` allows for up to 21 technology-specific ports.  Modify the individual ports or a
range as appropriate for your network.

* Modify the unit file ``/lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service``
```ini
[Unit]
Description=SC4S Container
After=network.service
Requires=network.service

[Service]
Environment="SC4S_IMAGE=splunk/scs:latest"

#Note Uncomment this line to use custom index names AND download the splunk_index.csv file template per getting started
Environment="SC4S_UNIT_SPLUNK_INDEX=-v /opt/sc4s/default/splunk_index.csv:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/context-local/splunk_index.csv"
#Note Uncomment the following two linese for host and ip based source type mapping AND download the two file templates per getting started
#Environment="SC4S_UNIT_VP_CSV=-v /opt/sc4s/default/vendor_product_by_source.csv:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/context-local/vendor_product_by_source.csv"
#Environment="SC4S_UNIT_VP_CONF=-v /opt/sc4s/default/vendor_product_by_source.conf:/opt/syslog-ng/etc/context-local/vendor_product_by_source.conf"
#Uncomment the following line if custom TLS certs are provided
#Environment="SC4S_TLS_DIR=-v /opt/sc4s/tls:/opt/syslog-ng/tls"

TimeoutStartSec=0
Restart=always
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman pull $SC4S_IMAGE
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/podman run \
        --env-file=/opt/sc4s/default/env_file \
        "$SC4S_UNIT_SPLUNK_INDEX" "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CSV" "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CONF" "$SC4S_TLS_DIR" \
        --name SC4S_preflight --rm \
        $SC4S_IMAGE -s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run -p 514:514 -p 5000-5020:5000-5020 \
        --env-file=/opt/sc4s/default/env_file \
        "$SC4S_UNIT_SPLUNK_INDEX"  "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CSV" "$SC4S_UNIT_VP_CONF" "$SC4S_TLS_DIR" \
        --name SC4S \
        --rm \
$SC4S_IMAGE
```

* Modify the following file ``/opt/sc4s/default/env_file`` to include the port-specific environment variable(s). See the "Sources" 
section for more information on your specific device(s).

* Update ``SPLUNK_HEC_URL`` and ``SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN`` to reflect the correct values for your environment

* Set `SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS` to match the number of indexers and/or HWFs with HEC endpoints.  If the endpoint is a VIP,
match this value to the total number of indexers behind the load balancer.

* NOTE:  Splunk Connect for Syslog defaults to secure configurations.  If you are not using trusted SSL certificates, be sure to
uncomment the last line in the example below.

```dotenv
SPLUNK_HEC_URL=https://splunk.smg.aws:8088/services/collector/event
SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN=a778f63a-5dff-4e3c-a72c-a03183659e94
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS=6
SPLUNK_CONNECT_METHOD=hec
SPLUNK_DEFAULT_INDEX=main
SPLUNK_METRICS_INDEX=em_metrics
SC4S_LISTEN_JUNIPER_NETSCREEN_TCP_PORT=5000
#Uncomment the following line if using untrusted SSL certificates
#SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_TLS_VERIFY=no
```

* Restart SC4S (below)

# Start SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl start sc4s
```

# Restart SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sc4s
```

If changes were made to the configuration Unit file above (e.g. to configure with dedicated ports), you must first stop SC4S and re-run 
the systemd configuration commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop sc4s
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo systemctl enable sc4s
sudo systemctl start sc4s
```

# Stop SC4S

```bash
sudo systemctl stop sc4s
```
# Verify Proper Operation

SC4S has a number of "preflight" checks to ensure that the container starts properly and that the syntax of the underlying syslog-ng
configuration is correct.  After this step completes, to verify SC4S is properly communicating with Splunk,
execute the following search in Splunk:

```ini
index=* sourcetype=sc4s:events "starting up"
```
This should yield the following event:
```ini
syslog-ng starting up; version='3.22.1'
``` 
when the startup process proceeds normally (without syntax errors). If you do not see this,
follow the steps below before proceeding to deeper-level troubleshooting:

* Check to see that the URL, token, and TLS/SSL settings are correct, and that the appropriate firewall ports are open (8088 or 443).

* Check to see that the proper indexes are created in Splunk, and that the token has access to them.

* Ensure the proper operation of the load balancer if used.

* Lastly, execute the following command to check the internal logs of the syslog-ng process running in the container.  Depending on the
traffic load, there may be quite a bit of output in the syslog-ng logs.
```bash
podman logs SC4S
```
You should see events similar to those below in the output:
```ini
Oct  1 03:13:35 77cd4776af41 syslog-ng[1]: syslog-ng starting up; version='3.22.1'
Oct  1 05:29:55 77cd4776af41 syslog-ng[1]: Syslog connection accepted; fd='49', client='AF_INET(10.0.1.18:55010)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:514)'
Oct  1 05:29:55 77cd4776af41 syslog-ng[1]: Syslog connection closed; fd='49', client='AF_INET(10.0.1.18:55010)', local='AF_INET(0.0.0.0:514)'
```
If you see http server errors such as 4xx or 5xx responses from the http (HEC) endpoint, one or more of the items above are likely set
incorrectly.  If validating/fixing the configuration fails to correct the problem, proceed to the "Troubleshooting" section for more
information.
